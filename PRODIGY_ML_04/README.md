# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition using CNN

This project implements a **Hand Gesture Recognition system** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The model is trained on image data to accurately classify different hand gestures, enabling applications in **human–computer interaction** and **gesture-based control systems**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Hand gesture recognition allows computers to understand and interpret human hand movements using images.  
In this project, a CNN is trained to learn visual patterns from hand gesture images and classify them into predefined gesture categories.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and preprocess hand gesture image data
- Build a CNN model for image classification
- Train and evaluate the model on unseen data
- Save the trained model
- Predict gestures from new images
